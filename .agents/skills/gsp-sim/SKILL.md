# GSP application preview

Read the [product preview guide](https://github.com/esp-mosaico/esp-mosaico-utils/blob/9a2d151928dd77165c899099c49c59b0edf537ae/mosaico-tools/tools/gsp-sim/README.md).
Create an application with `python mosaico.py project init <name>`; the template
is owned by utils, and there is no pre-created Hello World in this workspace.

After the first application build/reconfigure resolves ESP-GSP 1.5.1:

```sh
python mosaico.py project sim --project projects/<name> --interactive
python mosaico.py project sim --project projects/<name> --headless --duration 3
```

The public command selects explicit --project, current application, valid user
default or the sole created app. No internal Vibe Mode firmware or template directory is
selected implicitly. Native sim_bridge executes the application's portable C UI;
keep board/FreeRTOS/Iris out of the scene owner's `components/<name>/host/`
adapter. The runner falls back to `pc/` for older applications. Preserve
480×480 RGB565 and the shared scene.

Use --scene, --scene-only or --dump-ppm PATH only for static rendering; they do not run C
callbacks. Validate clicks, held input, counters and timers using the native
backend before device work. Tool resolution and preview orchestration are owned
by mosaico-tools; do not copy them into the workspace or an application.

Report the inspected flows, simulator evidence and remaining hardware-validation gaps.
